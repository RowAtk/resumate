# Make Question Queue
# Question Queue - LIFO queue designed to accept questions to send to the prompter
# This queue could take a question and a argument to specify what property the question comes from
# OR we can add this value to the question obj
# OR
# Property Queue
# This could be a queue (same as question queue) but for the properties in order to associate properties to questions
